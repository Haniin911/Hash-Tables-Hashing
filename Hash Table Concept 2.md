❗ What is a Collision in a Hash Table?
Let’s go back to the restaurant story.

You came up with a smart method (a hash function) that takes the food name and gives you a page number to find the price faster.

But here’s the problem…

🧩 What if two different food names give you the same page number?
For example:

Rice → page 3

Fish → page 3 as well!

Now both prices have to be stored on the same page.

That’s called a collision — when two different items (keys) end up in the same spot (index) in the table.

💬 Is That a Bad Thing?
Not necessarily!
But it slows things down because:

Now your cashier has to look through multiple items on the same page.

It defeats the goal of finding things quickly.

🤯 Can We Avoid Collisions Completely?
To be honest, it's almost impossible to create a perfect hash function that avoids all collisions — especially when you're dealing with many food items (or data).

There just aren’t enough unique page numbers for every possible name.

🧠 So What’s the Goal?
Your goal should be to:

Choose a good hash function that spreads the food names (or data) as evenly as possible, so that collisions happen less often.

Less collisions = faster lookups = happy cashier 🍽️ ✅
