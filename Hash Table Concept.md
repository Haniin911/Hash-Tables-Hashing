📘 The Hash Table Concept – A Simple Story
I'll explain the basics of creating a table using a short story.

🍽️ The Problem
I own a restaurant that serves a wide variety of food, but unfortunately, I only have one cashier.
He was slow at taking orders for some reason.

When I asked him about the delay, he said it was very difficult to look up the prices — and even harder to remember them all.

💡 The Idea
So I started thinking of another way to help him search for prices more quickly.

I said to myself:

"Why not use a small booklet and arrange the prices in a specific way?"

For example, I already have:

Rice for $9

Fish for $20

So I thought:

"Why not arrange foods that start with the same letter together on the same page inside the booklet? Wouldn't that be faster?"

🔍 The Challenge
But I realized I still needed a way to find each food item more efficiently — since many foods begin with the same letter.

So I started looking for a better method.

🧠 The Hashing Method

Let’s say I came up with a method that converts each food name into a specific number.

Then, I divided the booklet into a number of pages, each with a unique number.

For every food item, I calculated its number using my method.
That number became its page number.

I wrote the food's price on the page matching that number.

⚡ The Result
Now, whenever I needed the price of a food item:

I calculated the page number based on the food’s name.

Went directly to that page.

Found the price right there.

And just like that — no more delays.

✅ Takeaway
This story is a real-life analogy of how hash tables work:

The food name is the key.

The calculation method is the hash function.

The page is the index in the table.

The booklet is the hash table.

Fast lookups, minimal memory, and very efficient!
